# Note that the above example downloads SRTM data from the earthlab-srtm S3 bucket hosted by Amazon Web Services (AWS). There are other sources for SRTM data, and you
# can modify the script accordingly to download from a different source. Also, make sure to check the licensing terms and conditions for the SRTM data you are 
# downloading, as some may have restrictions on their use.

# Define the area of interest by specifying the coordinates of the bounding box:
	xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax = [70, 20, 80, 30] # example coordinates of area of interest

# Download the SRTM data for the specified area of interest using the rasterio package:

# Plot the downloaded SRTM data using earthpy and matplotlib:
	ep.plot_bands(srtm, cmap='Greys', title='SRTM Data') plt.show()
